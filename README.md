A simple, command-line Code Breaker game written in Python. Try to guess the secret code within a limited number of attempts!

Game Overview
In CodeBreaker, the computer generates a random secret code composed of digits (0–9).
Your goal is to deduce the code by making guesses. After each guess, you’ll receive feedback:

Right digit, right place: how many digits are exactly correct in both value and position.

Right digit, wrong place: how many digits appear in the code but in a different position.

Keep track of your clues, and crack the code before your attempts run out!
